## Contents

- **Input Data**
  - `M&A deals dataset.xlsx` – Anonymized dataset of M&A announcements used as input for the model.
    
  - `knowledge_base_signals.xlsx` – Empirical knowledge base containing the key variables historically associated with cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) in M&A transactions. For        each variable, the file specifies:
                                        - the expected direction of its impact on acquiror and/or target's CAR (positive or negative) on target 
                                        - the strength of the supporting empirical evidence (source count, p-values and relative significance_score).

    These variables are used by the multi-agent system as quantitative inputs: when the value of a variable in a given deal exceeds the activation thresholds (defined within           the Python script), the corresponding empirical signal is triggered and incorporated into the agents’ reasoning process during the evaluation of the deal.
    
  - `CAR_ground_truth.xlsx` – Historical CAR statistics used for empirical calibration and benchmarking.
    
  - `semantic_dictionary_mna.json` – Semantic dictionary used to detect positive and negative strategic cues in deal announcements.
 
- **Code**
  - `Multi_agent_script_finale.py` – Modular Python script implementing the multi-agent architecture (Proponent, Opponent, Expert, Manager) for predicting value creation in M&A deals.

- **Output**
  - `predictions.xlsx` – File containing the probability predictions generated by the multi-agent system for each deal.
  - `105_logs_pdf.zip` – Compressed logs detailing the reasoning of each agent for each deal of the sample, providing transparency into the deliberation process.

- **`README.md`** – Documentation and usage instructions.
