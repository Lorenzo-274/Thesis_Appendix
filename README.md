---
## Contents

- **Code**
  - `Multi_agent_script_finale.py` – Full modular Python script implementing the multi-agent architecture (Proponent, Opponent, Expert, Manager) for predicting value creation in        M&A deals.
  - `anonymization_M&A_deals_script.py` – Python script used to preprocess the original M&A deal announcements. It anonymizes company names, locations, and other identifiers,           and structures the resulting anonymized text for use by the multi-agent evaluation system. This step ensures that model predictions rely solely on strategic, semantic and   1      empirical features rather than firm-specific cues.

- **Input Data**
  - `M&A deals dataset.xlsx` – Anonymized dataset of M&A announcements used as input for the model. This file contains both the anonymized texts of the deal announcements and the       empirical variables (e.g., firm- and deal-level characteristics) required by the multi-agent system for evaluation. The quantitative variables included here correspond to          those listed in the empirical knowledge base.

  - `knowledge_base_signals.xlsx` – Empirical knowledge base containing the key variables historically associated with cumultative abnormal returns (CARs) in M&A transactions, as       identified in the literature review and included in `M&A deals dataset.xlsx`.
     For each variable, the file specifies:
                                          - the expected direction of its impact on acquiror and/or target's CAR (positive or negative) 
                                          - the strength of the supporting empirical evidence (source count, p-values and relative significance_score).

     These variables are used by the multi-agent system as quantitative inputs: when the value of a variable in a given deal exceeds the activation thresholds (defined within           the Python script), the corresponding empirical signal is triggered and incorporated into the agents’ reasoning process during the evaluation of the deal.
    
  - `CAR_ground_truth.xlsx` – Historical CAR statistics used for empirical calibration and benchmarking. This file provides aggregated CAR data to contextualize model performance;       however, the Manager agent does not access deal-level CAR values or their association with specific transactions, ensuring that predictions remain strictly ex-ante.

  - `semantic_dictionary_mna.json` – Semantic dictionary used to detect positive and negative strategic cues in deal announcements.
 
- **Output**
  - `predictions.xlsx` – File containing the probability predictions generated by the multi-agent system for each deal.
  - `105_logs_pdf.zip` – Compressed logs detailing the reasoning of each agent for each deal of the sample, providing transparency into the deliberation process.

- **`README.md`** – Documentation and usage instructions.
